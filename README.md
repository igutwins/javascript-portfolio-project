## Application Overview
This application helps individuals organize weekly volleyball games for friends and colleagues. 

The user of this app is the organizer. He or she has a predetermined list of individuals that may or may not join a given week’s game (i.e., an email distribution list). 

Each week, the organizer adds a new game through the UI and selects which individuals to add to the game using a drop down menu. The application then associates those players with that volleyball game so the organizer knows who will be coming and can balance teams / collect payment from each attendee.

## Deployment

To use the application, clone the repo and run “rails db:migrate” then “rails db:seed” to get a list of users (the email distribution list) so you can interact with the app.
